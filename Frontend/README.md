# Running the app

To run this application, you need NodeJS and NPM installed on your system (and angular cli globaly). Then, run the following commands from your command prompt:

```
npm install
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng serve
```

This will transpile the TypeScript files, bundle everything using Webpack, and start the Node server. The app will be available at [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)
